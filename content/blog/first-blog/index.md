## Building the Gatsby site

### Building this blog was both easier than I expected, but also a lot more complicated than I had anticipated

I know both of the headers in this post seem contradictory, but i promise they make sense. Building this
blog was easier in the sense that I actually found a template online as i was researching the process on how to actually build a blog using React. In the same breath, I had to restart this building a few times because the files would get corrupted (this was all my fault). 

```javascript
const myFunction = () => {
    let i = 0;
    return(i)
}
```

This is the ugly mug that you will be seeing as time goes by. Get used to me
